<h1 align="center">Course React with Hooks</h1>
<hr>
My repository for the projects I created to follow the free online course "<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/react-with-hooks-for-beginners/">React with Hooks for Beginners</a>" by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/moath-zayadneh-78a82119a/">Moath Zayadneh</a>.

<h2>Some details:</h2>
<ul>
<li>I decided to create the project using <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a>. It's an amazing development environment, recommendation of my brother and I'm really thankful that I got to know about it.</li>
<li>I also decided to dig deeper in terms of learning ESlint and Prettier best practices, so they're implemented in the project although they're not mentioned in the Course</li>
<li>The course is an amazing starting point for those who, like me, are complete rookies in React.</li>
<li>I learned about Components, Hooks (useState and useEffect), Classes (although Functional Componets are clearly shaping the present and future of React, I think it's necessary to at least have a base understanding of how the library works with them), Axios API, project structure, etc.</li>
<li>Got me motivated to keep learning, and that's what I'm mainly thankful about!</li>
</ul>
